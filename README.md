# Docker Playground

This repo has everything you need to get started with Docker. It
includes a Vagrantfile for a virtual machine that will serve as our
docker host and a couple of Dockerfiles to show how everything works.


By the end, it will set up a couple images that can be used to run a
rails application in a container.
